## **Background**
This is a trading algorithm that allocates and ranks stocks based on GARCH forecasts.
The GARCH model is parametrized using MLE and simulated using Monte Carlo.
A PDF has been included which goes over the theory of the algorithm.

**_This algorithm does not always perform well so please, for your own good, don't trade on it (even though you probably weren't going to)._**
